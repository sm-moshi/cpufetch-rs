## ‚ú® Features

- **Comprehensive CPU Data**
  Detects and displays CPU vendor, model name, microarchitecture, core/thread counts, and detailed frequency information.

- **Extensive Feature Flag Support**
  Accurately parses and lists supported instruction sets such as SSE, AVX, FMA, and more.

- **Elegant ASCII Art & Layout**
  Presents information in a visually appealing, terminal‚Äëfriendly format with vendor‚Äëspecific logos.

- **Cross‚ÄëPlatform Compatibility**
  Works on Linux, macOS, and Windows (where supported) without external C dependencies.

- **Modern Rust Implementation**
  Leverages Rust's safety, performance, and modularity to ensure reliable, maintainable code.

- **Feature Detection**: Dynamic CPU feature detection for:
  - x86_64: SSE, SSE2, SSE3, SSSE3, SSE4.1, SSE4.2, AVX, AVX2, FMA, BMI1, BMI2, etc.
  - ARM64: NEON, AES, PMULL, SHA1, SHA2, CRC32, ATOMICS, etc.

## üöÄ Installation

### üì¶ Via Cargo

Install cpufetch‚Äërs directly with Cargo:

```bash
cargo install cpufetch
```

### üõ†Ô∏è From Source

Clone the repository and build it:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sm-moshi/cpufetch‚Äërs.git
cd cpufetch‚Äërs
cargo build --release
./target/release/cpufetch
```

---

## üß™ Testing

Run the full test suite with:

```bash
cargo test
```

Our tests include unit tests for CPUID parsing, architecture detection, layout formatting, and full integration tests that simulate complete CLI execution.

---

## üó∫Ô∏è Roadmap

The project is organized into several key phases to achieve full feature parity with the original cpufetch:

1. **Project Setup & Core Scaffold**
   Establish a robust Rust project structure with CI, core modules, and error handling.
2. **CPU Information Module**
   Develop modules to parse CPUID data, extract feature flags, and measure CPU frequencies.
3. **Architecture Detection**
   Implement platform‚Äëspecific detection (x86_64, AArch64) and unify it under a common API.
4. **ASCII Art & Printer Module**
   Design the terminal output engine, including dynamic logo selection and layout formatting.
5. **CLI Interface**
   Build a comprehensive CLI using clap to support options like `--logo-only`, `--no-logo`, `--ascii`, and `--json`.
6. **Utility Functions & Integration**
   Create shared helpers for formatting and system inquiries; integrate all modules in `main.rs`.
7. **Documentation & Testing**
   Finalize the manpage, README, and comprehensive tests to ensure full feature parity.
8. **Packaging & Distribution**
   Prepare binaries for multiple platforms and publish to Crates.io.

For a more detailed plan, refer to our [ROADMAP.md](docs/ROADMAP.md) and [TODO.md](docs/TODO.md).
